# Function Documentation Overview
This page contains additional documentation for each function within PASTa, as well as examples of inputs.

# Data Preparation Functions
This set of functions is used to prepare raw photometry data, match it with experimental metadata, and load data into a structure in MATLAB. Functions are provided to handle data collected via TDT equipment and software Synapse, or a generic file structure with data streams saved to CSV files.

## loadKeys
Combines subject key and file key into a data structure, and appends the provided computeruserpath to the paths in the file key.

**INPUTS:**

* __COMPUTERUSERPATH:__ A variable containing the unique portion of the file explorer path for the users specific computer. For example, 'C:\Users\rmdon\'. Make sure the computeruserpath ends in a forward slash.
* __SUBJECTKEYNAME:__ A variable containing a string with the name of the subject key csv file for the experiment (see _"3. Data Analysis Pipeline"_ for more details). To omit a subject key and only load in the file key, set subjectkeyname = "".
* __FILEKEYNAME:__ A variable containing a string with the name of the file key csv file for the experiment (see _"3. Data Analysis Pipeline"_ for more details).

**OUTPUTS:**

* __EXPERIMENTKEY:__ A data structure called "experimentkey" that includes the joined file key and subject key with the computer user path appended to raw and extracted folder paths.

**EXAMPLE:**
```
computeruserpath =  'C:\Users\MYNAME\'; % Computer specific portion of file navigation paths
subjectkeyname = 'Subject Key.csv'; % Name of csv file containing subject information; set to '' if not using a subject key
filekeyname = 'File Key.csv'; % Name of csv file containing session information, raw data folder names, and paths

[experimentkey] = loadKeys(computeruserpath, subjectkeyname, filekeyname); % Load keys into a data structure called experimentkey
```

**NOTES:**

* FILEKEY must contain at a minimum the fields _Subject_, _RawFolderPath_, and _ExtractedFolderPath_. 
* SUBJECTKEY must contain at a minimum the field _Subject_
* Folder paths must end with a slash.
* The subject and file keys are joined based on Subject ID. Subject key must contain every subjects in the file key. If there is a mismatch, you will receive an error message that the right table does not contain all the key variables that are in the left table. The error message will display the unique subject IDs present in each key so you can determine where the mismatch occurred.
* Fields in subject and file key must be named uniquely. The only field that should be named the same in both keys is Subject.

## extractTDTdata
This function is used to extract TDT data from saved blocks recorded via the software _Synapse_. For each block, extractTDTdata calls the function "TDTbin2mat" (TDT, 2019) and inputs the RawFolderPath to extract fiber photometry data recorded with Synapse. Extracted blocks are parsed it into a single data structure containing all fields, streams, and epocs. Extracted signal streams are trimmed to remove the first 5 seconds by default (trimming can be adjusted if desired). The function will identify the signal channel by matching the names in the input SIGSTREAMNAMES and the control channel by matching the names in the input BAQSTREAMNAMES. The name inputs can include a list of stream names if channel naming conventions vary by rig. Each block is saved as a separate data structure in a '.mat' file at the location specified by the inputs in extractedfolderpaths. 

**INPUTS:**

* __RAWFOLDERPATHS:__ a string array containing the paths to the folder location of the raw data blocks to be extracted. The string array should contain one column with each full path in a separate row.
* __EXTRACTEDFOLDERPATHS:__ a string array containing the paths to the folder location in which to save the extracted MatLab structs for each block to be extracted. The string array should contain one column with each full path in a separate row.  
* __SIGSTREAMNAMES:__ A cell array containing strings with the names of the streams to be treated as signal. Note that only one stream per file can be treated as signal. If different files have different stream names, include all stream names in the cell array.
* __BAQSTREAMNAMES:__ A cell array containing strings with the names of the streams to be treated as background. Note that only one stream per file can be treated as background. If different files have different stream names, include all stream names in the cell array.

**OPTIONAL INPUTS:**

* __TRIM:__ the number of seconds to remove on either end of the data streams. If not specified, defaults to 5 seconds.
* __SKIPEXISTING:__ A binary variable containing a 0 if pre-existing extracted blocks should be re-extracted or a 1 if pre-existing extracted blocks should be skipped. This allows the user to toggle whether or not to extract every block, or only blocks that have not previously been extracted. If not specified, defaults to 1 (skip previously extracted blocks).

**OUTPUTS:**

Saved .mat data structures for each block in the location specified by extractedfolderpaths.

**EXAMPLE - DEFAULT:**
```
sigstreamnames = {'x65A', '465A'}; % All names of signal streams across files
baqstreamnames = {'x05A', '405A'}; % All names of background streams across files
rawfolderpaths = string({experimentkey.RawFolderPath})'; % Create string array of raw folder paths
extractedfolderpaths = string({experimentkey.ExtractedFolderPath})'; % Create string array of extracted folder paths

extractTDTdata(rawfolderpaths,extractedfolderpaths,sigstreamnames,baqstreamnames); % extract data
```

**EXAMPLE - MANUALLY SPECIFIED TRIM AND SKIPEXISTING:**
```
trim = 3;
skipexisting = 0;
sigstreamnames = {'x65A', '465A'}; % All names of signal streams across files
baqstreamnames = {'x05A', '405A'}; % All names of background streams across files
rawfolderpaths = string({experimentkey.RawFolderPath})'; % Create string array of raw folder paths'
extractedfolderpaths = string({experimentkey.ExtractedFolderPath})'; % Create string array of extracted folder paths'

extractTDTdata(rawfolderpaths,extractedfolderpaths,sigstreamnames,baqstreamnames,'trim',trim,'skipexisting',skipexisting); % extract data
```

## loadTDTdata
For use with previously extracted data collect with TDT equipment and software Synapse. loadTDTData loads previously extracted .mat data blocks into a data structure for further analysis. Each block is one row. The input experiment key must include at a minimum the extracted folder path location of the block. Any additional information about the subject and session in the experiment key will be matched to the extracted data.

**INPUTS:**

* __EXPERIMENTKEY:__ A prepared data structure with at minimum the ExtractedFolderPath containing the full path to the individual session data structures to be loaded. The EXPERIMENTKEY can be prepared with the LOADKEYS function.

**OUTPUTS:**

the whole session. This input only needs to be specified if not using the format output from the FINDSESSIONTRANSIENTS functions. _Default: 'maxloc'_
* __BINLENGTHMINS:__ Numeric; Bin length in number of minutes. _Default: 5_
* __NBINSOVERRIDE:__ Numeric; Manual override to set the number of bins. If set to anything other than 0, users can override the stream-length based calculation of the number of bins per session and set their own number. _Default: 0_


**OUTPUTS:**

* __DATA:__ The original data structure with sessiontransients_localmin_THRESHOLDLABEL added in. For more details on individual variables, see the PASTa user guide page _Transient Detection_. The output contains four nested tables: 
    * _INPUTS:_ Includes all function inputs.
    * _TRANSIENTQUANTIFICATION:_ Includes the quantified variables for each transient, including amplitude, rise time, fall time, width, and AUC. 
    * _TRANSIENTSTREAMLOCS:_ Pre-transient baseline (local minimum), transient peak, rise, and fall locations for each transient to match the cut transient stream data.
    * _TRANSIENTSTREAMDATA:_ Cut data stream from baseline window start to the end of the post-transient period for each transient event.


**NOTES:**

* If called outside the main _findSessionTransients_ function, note that users will have to input all parameters manually and no defaults will be applied.
* As for the main function, threshold values should be calculated before using the findSessionTransients functions. Typically thresholds are set to 2-3 SDs. If the input data stream is Z scored, this can be the actual SD threshold number. If the input data stream is not Z scored, find the corresponding value to 2-3 SDs for each subject.
* For transient data outputs, each transient is in a separate row. 
* If OUTPUTTRANSIENTDATA is set to anything other than 1, the TRANSIENTSTREAMLOCS and TRANSIENTSTREAMDATA tables will be skipped and not included in the output.


**EXAMPLE:**
```
% Prepare thresholds - since Z scored streams will be analyzed, input threshold as the desired SD.
for eachfile = 1:length(data)
    data(eachfile).threshold3SD = 3;
end

% Find session transients by directly called in the findSessionTransients_localmin function
[data] = findSessionTransients_localmin(data,'sigfiltz_normsession_trimmed','threshold3SD','fs',800,100,2000,0.5,1);
```

## exportSessionTransients
Used to create a table of all transient events across all sessions included in the file key and data structure, and exports the table of transient quantification to a csv file. This function depends on the output from _findSessionTransients_. The creation of a csv file is helpful for users who prefer to run statistical analyses or make plots in other programs than MATLAB, such as R Studio.

**INPUTS:**

* __DATA:__ This is a structure that contains at least the output from _findSessionTransients_.
* __WHICHTRANSIENTS:__ The name (string) of the parent field containing the table of transietns that you want to identify bins for. This is the output of the _findSessionTransients_ function. The name usually follows the convention *sessiontransients_WHICHBLTYPE_WHICHTHRESHOLD*
* __EXPORTFILEPATH:__ A string with the path to the folder location where the created table should be saved to. NOTE: The path must end in a forward slash.
* __ADDVARIABLES:__ A cell array containing any additional variables from the data structure to be added to the transients table. Variables will be added to every row of the output structure. Cell array inputs must be the names of fields in the data structure. At a minimum, this should contain the subject ID. If multiple sessions per subject are included in the data structure, make sure a session ID variable is also included. For example: {'Subject', 'SessionID', 'Treatment'}


**OPTIONAL INPUTS:**
* __WHICHTRANSIENTSTABLE:__ The name (string) of the field within WHICHTRANSIENTS that contains the quantification of individual transient events. This input only needs to be specified if not using the format output from the FINDSESSIONTRANSIENTS functions. _Default: 'transientquantification'_
* __FILENAME:__ A string with a custom name for the output csv file. If not specified, the file name will be generated as *'WHICHTRANSIENTS_AllSessionExport_DAY-MONTH-YEAR.csv'*


**OUTPUTS:**

* This function outputs a csv file with all transients for all sessions in the data structure. The file will be output at the specified file path. 
* If the function is called into an object, the table ALLTRANSIENTS will also be saved to an object in the MATLAB workspace. 


**NOTES:**

* The file path must include the full path for the folder including the computer address, and must end in a forward slash. If the file path is not specified properly, the function won't be able to automatically save the csv file.
* Make sure to add all relevant experimental variables to the ADDVARIABLES list. This includes at a minimum the Subject ID and a session ID, but it's wise to include other key variables to make future analyses easier. Alternatively, you can keep only the Subject ID and a session ID and match the data to the subject and file keys later, which would include all subject and experimental variables.


**EXAMPLE:**
```
% Export transients with added fields for subject and treatment=
addvariables = {'Subject','TreatNum','InjType'}; % Prepare variables to append to each transient

% To just output the csv file:
exportSessionTransients(data,'sessiontransients_blmean_threshold3SD',analysispath,addvariables);

% To output the csv file and add the created table to a MATLAB data structure:
alltransients = exportSessionTransients(data,'sessiontransients_blmean_threshold3SD',analysispath,addvariables);
```


# Visualization and Plotting Functions
## plotTraces
Main function to plot whole session fiber photometry traces. This function will plot the streams sig, baq, baq_scaled, sigsub, and sigfilt for a single session. Use this function in a loop to plot streams for all sessions in the data structure. This plot function plots the data streams with time in minutes on the x axis. To modify the plot or add additional features like session relevant time stamps, use the plot in a loop. Modified plots must be saved in the external loop. If modifications are not neccesaary, then optional inputs can be specified to directly output and save the plot to a filepath location.


**INPUTS:**

* __DATA:__ This is a structure that contains at least the data stream you want to analyze, a field with the threshold values, and a field with the sampling rate of the data stream.
* __WHICHFILE:__ The file number to be plotted.
* __MAINTITLE:__ The main title (string) to be displayed for the overall plot above the individual tiles. For example, '427 - Treatment: Morphine'


**OPTIONAL INPUTS:**

* __SAVEOUTPUT:__ Set to 1 to automatically save trace plots as png to the plot file path. _Default: 0_
* __PLOTFILEPATH:__ Required if SAVEOUTPUT is set to 1. The specific path to save the plot to. Note that this must be the entire path from computer address to folder ending in the filename for the specific plot. For example: 'C:\Users\rmdon\Box\Injection Transients\Figures\SessionTraces_427_Morphine.png'

**OUTPUTS:**

* __ALLTRACES:__ A plot object containing subplots for each input stream.

**EXAMPLE: Single Session**
```
%% Plot the first session and automatically save the output
maintitle = append(num2str(data(1).Subject),' - Treatment: ',data(1).InjType); % Create title string for current plot
plotfilepath = 'C:\Users\rmdon\Box\Injection Transients\Figures\SessionTraces_427_Morphine.png';  % Create plot file path for the current plot

plotTraces(data,1,maintitle,'saveoutput',1,'plotfilepath',plotfilepath);
```


**EXAMPLE: All Sessions**
```
%% Plot whole session streams for each file
% Use plotTraces to plot all raw traces - data needs to contain sig, baq, baq_scaled, sigsub, and sigfilt.
for eachfile = 1:length(data)
    maintitle = append(num2str(data(eachfile).Subject),' - Treatment: ',data(eachfile).InjType); % Create title string for current plot
    alltraces = plotTraces(data,eachfile,maintitle);
    for eachtile = 1:5
        nexttile(eachtile)
        xline(data(eachfile).injt(1),'--','Injection','Color','#C40300','FontSize',8)
        xline(data(eachfile).injt(2),'--','Color','#C40300','FontSize',8)
    end    

    set(gcf, 'Units', 'inches', 'Position', [0, 0, 8, 9]);
    plotfilepath = append(figurepath,'SessionTraces_',num2str(data(eachfile).Subject),'_',data(eachfile).InjType,'.png');
    exportgraphics(gcf,plotfilepath,'Resolution',300)
end
```
