# PASTa User Guide
This user guide is meant to serve as a detailed step-by-step practical guide through preparing, processing, and analyzing fiber photometry data with the PASTa protocol. Each section includes descriptions of each step, provides examples of fiber photometry recordings to show the effect on the data, and provides details on the required functions.

For specific function troubleshooting, see the [Function Documentation](https://rdonka.github.io/PASTaUserGuide/functiondocumentation/) page.
