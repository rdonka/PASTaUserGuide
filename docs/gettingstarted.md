# Getting Started with PASTa
Here you'll find the quick start guide to set up __PASTa__ with instructions on installation and basic use of the toolbox. Once your device is set up, move to the [User Guide](https://rdonka.github.io/PASTaUserGuide/userguide/userguide/) for detailed documentation on the use of the PASTa Protocol for analysis.

# Set Up and Installation
PASTa was developed and primarily tested on Windows. Use in other operating systems may require adaptation of functions and analysis example scripts. For Mac users, we've attempted to integrate additional instructions but some troubleshooting may be required.


## GitHub and GitHub Desktop

Install GitHub Desktop if you haven't already. Make an account on GitHub, note that students get access to premium features for free through the student developer pack once verified. Install GitHub Desktop and set up a location for your repositories on your local computer. For newer users, we recommend making a folder on your desktop called "GitHubRepositories" and cloning all repositories there. This makes it very easy to locate your repositories.
