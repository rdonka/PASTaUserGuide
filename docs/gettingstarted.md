# Welcome to the PASTa Quick Start Guide!
PASTa (Photometry Analysis and Signal Processing Toolbox) is a MATLAB toolbox developed for signal processing anad analysis of fiber photometry data. The toolbox is written to be user-friendly and approachable for people at all levels of coding, with flexible functions to make analysis of a wide variety of experimental designs feasible. Functions are included for data management and organization, signal processing, and experimental analyses including whole session and event/trial specific designs. Here you'll find the quick start guide to PASTa with instructions on set up and installation, and instructions for basic use of the toolbox.

# Set Up and Installation

## GitHub and GitHub Desktop

Install GitHub Desktop if you haven't already. Make an account on GitHub, note that students get access to premium features for free through the student developer pack once verified. Install GitHub Desktop and set up a location for your repositories on your local computer. For newer users, we recommend making a folder on your desktop called "GitHubRepositories" and cloning all repositories there. This makes it very easy to locate your repositories.
